# Battleship
I originally made this in high school to preemptively finish an upcoming assignment.  When launched, the player must set up their ships.  You must left click on the initial spot for your carrier, then left click on the ending spot for the ship (five spaces total).  Then continue this for the battleship (4 spaces), cruiser (3), submarine (3), and gunboat (2).  From current testing, it doesn't seem that you can reset your selection.  After you set up all the ships, you can begin to play against the opponent.  Left click on the opponent's ships.  They will attempt to sink your own ships, by random selection until it hits something whereupon it will search around the hit.  The status bar at the bottom will tell you if either of you win.  Sounds should play for each hit/miss you make and for a win/loss.
